// Iteration on maps are possible because they are iterables.

//In Objects we need Object.entries() to loop over it because they are not iterables. But we don't need like that in Maps because thet iterables.

//Here with only question.keys() and question.values() we get all keys with an map iterator. so that we spread or seperated them into an array with spread operator.

//Other Map Methods that also had in arrays and objects.
// console.log(question.keys())
// console.log(question.values())
// console.log(question.entries())
